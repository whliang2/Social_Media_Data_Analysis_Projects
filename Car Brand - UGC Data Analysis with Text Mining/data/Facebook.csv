BentleyMotors , 124079284292042 , 253667121386004 , The new Bentley Continental GTC V8 convertible will make its official public debut at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show.  ," A NEW BENTLEY ENGINE EARNS ITS WINGS.  Although closely related to the GT, the Continental GTC V8 has its own distinct character. Those iconic Bentley features of dominant bonnet line, prominent matrix grille and twin large inner headlamps confirm its pedigree, while the wide track and four-square stance emphasise the performance focus of an all-wheel drive supercar. At the rear, wrap-around lamps accentuate the low, wide proportions, flanking a distinctive Bentley ‘double-horseshoe’ boot lid with a spoiler on its upper edge.  Distinguishing features for the V8 model include a red enamel winged ‘B’ badge, gloss black grille with bright chrome surround, three-segment front bumper and the ‘figure eight’ tailpipes at the rear.  To call the Continental GTC V8 a convertible understates its capabilities. It is both a sensational open tourer when the weather permits and a practical year-round proposition, as well insulated and refined as a coupé thanks to its four-layer roof.  And for the owner of a Continental GTC V8, one of the incidental pleasures of hood-down motoring is the chance to enjoy the V8’s mechanical symphony…in full surround sound.  http://www.bentleymotors.com/models/new_continental_gtc_v8/ ", 2012-03-05T15:07:56+0000 , 2012-03-09T05:05:34+0000 ,15,276,4, 2012-03-05,15:07:56,2012-03-05,1,afternoon, photo 
BentleyMotors , 124079284292042 , 241713539254947 ," The New Continental GTC V8 convertible makes its official public debut at the Geneva Motor Show on 6 March, 2012. The new 4.0 litre, twin turbocharged Continental GTC V8, and its coupe counterpart the Continental GT V8, achieve exceptional standards for power-to-emissions in the high luxury sports car sector.This remarkable, new Bentley V8 engine delivers maximum power of 500 bhp (507 PS / 373 Kw) at 6000 rev/min and an extraordinary peak torque of 660 Nm (487 lb ft) which is available across virtually the entire rev range from 1700 to 5000 rev/min, providing exhilarating performance and effortless power delivery in the Bentley tradition. Combined with a new close-ratio 8-speed automatic transmission, this translates into a 0-60 mph sprint time of 4.7 seconds for the GTC (0-100 km/h in 5.0 seconds) and a top speed of 187 mph (301 km/h).At the same time, the new V8 Continental models achieve outstanding levels of fuel efficiency and CO2emissions for the luxury performance sector and are capable of travelling over 500 miles (800 km) on a single tank of fuel.Read more at Bentley Motors.com ", , 2012-03-05T15:04:13+0000 , 2012-03-05T15:59:47+0000 ,0,216,6, 2012-03-05,15:04:13,2012-03-05,1,afternoon, link

With eAssist, fuel flow to the engine is cut off during coasting.3.) Benefitting from good aerodynamics can be easy.

We'd like to set the record straight in this regard. Ford does not support SOPA nor do we regularly take positions on any legislation.In September, Ford signed a letter to Congress expressing the need to protect our intellectual property - there are hordes of counterfeiters out there who make Ford parts and goods that are not officially licensed, hence our interest. Plus, we have a significant commitment to the technology field, with lots of efforts that result in proprietary information that, if it were compromised, would be counter-productive. This hurts our licensees and our customers and is not tolerable.While we want to ensure our IP is protected, we do not encourage legislation that fundamentally changes the Internet. We have expressed interest in working WITH Congress to find a balance that keeps the Internet open yet protects intellectual property. There is much more value in working together to find a solution to creating an environment where the next big ideas can flourish.

Why did you decide to become an apprentice?  “An apprenticeship is a great way to get into the industry of your choice and a good building block for life experience and for the relevant industry.”   What factors first drove you to consider a career in manufacturing?  “My ‘hands-on’ approach to life, strong kinaesthetic learning and my ambition to be involved in the automotive industry.”   What attracted you to Rolls-Royce Motor Cars as a company?  “I was attracted to Rolls-Royce because of the brand, the level of perfection and the great business status.”   What were the biggest challenges you faced starting your apprenticeship?  “Getting the correct frame of mind for the precision that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars work to.”   What have been the highlights of your time working for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars so far?  “The level of perfection and the different skills that I have already learnt after just 6 months.”   What skills do you think you have learnt through the apprenticeship?  “The way in which the manufacturing plant works, also, specific skills on how to perfect a part before it goes into such an prestigious car.”   What are the benefits of being an automotive apprentice?  “The enjoyment of being part of such an exciting industry and being able to learn not only vehicle manufacture, but manufacturing in general, i.e. the way a factory setting works.”   Would you recommend apprenticeships to others?  “I would definitely recommend apprenticeships because of the amount of hands on experience that you get.
