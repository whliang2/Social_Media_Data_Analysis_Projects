Bentley is offering a vision of the future with a dramatic new Sport Utility Vehicle concept, EXP 9 F, at the Geneva International Salon d’Auto. The Company’s designers and engineers have created a compelling new take on the Grand Touring Bentley - a vehicle that feels equally at home at an opera gala performance, on the sand dunes and the overtaking lane of the autobahn.Unmistakably a Bentley – yet a Bentley like none before it – the EXP 9 F could herald a third Bentley model-line alongside the bespoke Mulsanne and the high performance Continental GT, GTC and Flying Spur.Today a global luxury brand with a network of 160 dealers from Shanghai to Beverly Hills, Bentley has an increasingly diverse customer base spanning every continent. For many customers, a dramatically styled, Bentley all-wheel drive SUV which combines a spacious, versatile cabin and commanding driving position, with Bentley’s hallmark power, performance, advanced technology and hand crafted luxury, would be a natural choice both on and off-road.“We are very excited by the potential of a high performance, ultra-luxury Bentley SUV. We know that many Bentley customers already own SUVs, admiring their style, luxury, performance and versatility. With EXP 9 F, Bentley is making a clear statement of intent that we have both the expertise and desire to meet and exceed their expectations.” Wolfgang Dürheimer, Chairman and Chief Executive, Bentley Motors.EXP9F.com",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012-03-05T19:39:37+0000","2012-03-06T05:42:19+0000",0,84,4,"2012-03-05","19:39:37","2012-03-05",1,"night","status",139

Although closely related to the GT, the Continental GTC V8 has its own distinct character. Those iconic Bentley features of dominant bonnet line, prominent matrix grille and twin large inner headlamps confirm its pedigree, while the wide track and four-square stance emphasise the performance focus of an all-wheel drive supercar. At the rear, wrap-around lamps accentuate the low, wide proportions, flanking a distinctive Bentley ‘double-horseshoe’ boot lid with a spoiler on its upper edge.  Distinguishing features for the V8 model include a red enamel winged ‘B’ badge, gloss black grille with bright chrome surround, three-segment front bumper and the ‘figure eight’ tailpipes at the rear.  To call the Continental GTC V8 a convertible understates its capabilities. It is both a sensational open tourer when the weather permits and a practical year-round proposition, as well insulated and refined as a coupé thanks to its four-layer roof.

Combined with a new close-ratio 8-speed automatic transmission, this translates into a 0-60 mph sprint time of 4.7 seconds for the GTC (0-100 km/h in 5.0 seconds) and a top speed of 187 mph (301 km/h).At the same time, the new V8 Continental models achieve outstanding levels of fuel efficiency and CO2emissions for the luxury performance sector and are capable of travelling over 500 miles (800 km) on a single tank of fuel.Read more at Bentley Motors.com",NA,NA,NA,"http://www.bentleymotors.com/models/new_continental_gtc_v8/","www.bentleymotors.com",NA,"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v1/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif","2012-03-05T15:04:13+0000","2012-03-05T15:59:47+0000",0,216,6,"2012-03-05","15:04:13","2012-03-05",1,"afternoon","link",123

The lead had to be defended. Enzo Ferrari decided to build a small series of Spiders to compete for the challenging new World Title. Thus the pinnacle of Scuderia cars was born 1954, named 375 Plus. The extremely strong V12 engine was planned by Aurelio Lampredi, the design perfected by Pinifarina. The teamwork lead to three successive wins: Agadir, Silverstone and Le Mans. And lets not forget the most important win, at the Carrera Panamericana with Umberto Maglioli.

This project has been set up to offer accessories and features for those, who want to create a truly unique Ferrari. The owners of a 599 GTB Fiorano for example can ask for carbon fibre details to improve the avant-garde theme of the car as well as her sportivity: from the headlights and the timeless look, to the Scudettis on the wings, for a three-dimensional Prancing Horse. The handles in carbon fibre look with technical and dynamic paint and the petrol cap based on the 360 Challenge... built in alloy to improve the details’ technology.Visit the special section: a Ferrari becomes unique thanks to you!Click here: http://bit.ly/wbIQ9q",NA,"http://external.ak.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAgYdqMxqJCY-8o&w=90&h=90&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.ferrari.com%2FSite_Collection_Image_115x55%2F599_gto_menu_2_dx_ok.png",NA,"599 GTB Carbon fibre details - Photo Gallery","www.ferrari.com","Ferrari Genuine","http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v1/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif","2012-01-13T17:13:20+0000","2012-01-17T10:49:56+0000",314,3543,56,"2012-01-13","17:13:20","2012-01-13",5,"afternoon","link",54

We'd like to set the record straight in this regard. Ford does not support SOPA nor do we regularly take positions on any legislation.In September, Ford signed a letter to Congress expressing the need to protect our intellectual property - there are hordes of counterfeiters out there who make Ford parts and goods that are not officially licensed, hence our interest. Plus, we have a significant commitment to the technology field, with lots of efforts that result in proprietary information that, if it were compromised, would be counter-productive. This hurts our licensees and our customers and is not tolerable.While we want to ensure our IP is protected, we do not encourage legislation that fundamentally changes the Internet. We have expressed interest in working WITH Congress to find a balance that keeps the Internet open yet protects intellectual property.

The answer is probably not.  The reason why is the independent front suspension system on our Sierra HD offers up to a 25% increase in front axle rating - up to 6,000 lbs (2,721kg) front gross axle rating (FGAWR) while also supporting improved ride and handling characteristics, versus our previous suspension.  Our Sierra independent front suspension can do everything a solid front axle can do, while providing a better ride.
